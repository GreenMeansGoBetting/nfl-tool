# GMG NBA Suite

Started 2026-10-11; the 2026-27 season tips off 2026-10-20. The user wants the NBA version of the
site on the same website, reached from a suite dropdown. The brand is "GMG Sports Data Suite";
NFL and NBA are suites inside it. More background: `docs/history.md`, "NBA".

## Suite switcher and launch switch

- `addSuiteSwitcher` (sync.js; `.suite-*` styles): the topbar brand ("GMG NFL SUITE") becomes a
  dropdown listing every suite in `SUITES` (NFL, NBA, NHL since 2026-10-13).
- **LAUNCHED 2026-10-13: both suites are open to every member** (`SUITE_SWITCH_PUBLIC = true`
  in sync.js adds `html.suite-public`, which shows the dropdown to everyone and takes the guard
  off the NBA and NHL pages). The owner had been advertising the NHL tools while the switch was
  still off, so members who opened an NHL link got the guard's note ("GMG NHL Suite is being
  built ... Check back soon") for over two hours and the owner took the site for broken:
  "YES! I have been advertising it! Get it up and going. You can open both to the public!"
- The guard is still in the pages (`.nba-app` hidden and `.nba-soon` shown without
  `suite-public`, suite.css) and one switch covers both suites. **Never set it back to false
  unless the owner asks**; a test (`test_the_suite_is_open_to_every_member`) fails if it is.
- Members now see these pages, so a broken NBA or NHL page is a broken page for paying members.
  The deploy's gate still leaves them out (their data builds may fail on their own): check them
  with `tools/check_site.py --only nhl` / `--only nba` before any push that touches them.
- Still owner-only: the "Update Odds" buttons.

## Data: sportsdataverse / hoopR

The basketball sister of nflverse. Season files are GitHub release assets at
`sportsdataverse/sportsdataverse-data` (tags `espn_nba_*`, files named by the year the season
ENDS: 2027 = 2026-27), scraped from ESPN and refreshed daily in season.

- Checked 2026-10-11: `espn_nba_pbp` (play-by-play, ~640k plays a season, shot coordinates,
  players, clock, score), `espn_nba_team_boxscores`, `espn_nba_player_boxscores`,
  `espn_nba_schedules`, `espn_nba_rosters`, `espn_nba_depthcharts` and `espn_nba_injuries` (daily
  snapshots), plus `nba_stats_*` sets (shots, lineups, possessions).
- Parquet only is practical (the pbp CSV is 275 MB), so `pyarrow` is in requirements.txt.
- A season's box / pbp files don't exist until its first game (404); the build then uses last
  season's stats (`is_fallback_season`) with players placed on this season's rosters.
- Not usable: `cdn.nba.com` / stats.nba.com (blocked with 403 from the user's PC and commonly
  from cloud builders). ESPN's own API (`site.api.espn.com/.../basketball/nba/scoreboard`,
  `summary`) works and is what hoopR scrapes; use it if same-day freshness is ever needed.
- **Odds: Novig** has NBA on the same public feed (`events?league=NBA`, same
  `EventMarkets_Query`). Events are matched to games by team nickname + start time. Only
  `OPEN_PREGAME` events are read, and a game that has tipped keeps the lines of the last build
  before tip-off (`apply_lines`), so in-game lines never show.

## Build

- `nfl_tool/nba/build_nba.py --season 2027 --out nfl_tool/site/nba/data.json` (deploy.yml step
  "Build NBA data", `continue-on-error`, so it can never block the NFL deploy). Local: add
  `--cached --data-dir data/nba` to reuse downloads.
- Output: `teams`, `team_stats` (per-100 ratings, pace, four factors, 3s, paint / fast break /
  points off turnovers, each as `off_*` and the matching `def_*` allowed), `recent_games`,
  `players` (12-man rotation per team, per game + last 5), `injuries`, `schedule` (yesterday
  through 14 days out, Novig lines), `novig_debug`.
- Team keys are ESPN abbreviations (NY, GS, SA, NO, UTAH, WSH).
- Times are converted with a fixed UTC-4, so they read an hour late after the November clock
  change until that's handled.
- ESPN's `turnover_points` is points GIVEN UP off turnovers, so the sides are swapped on purpose.
- All-Star / exhibition sides appear in the box scores; only the 30 real teams are counted.

## Pages

- `site/nba/index.html` + `nba.js` = NBA Game Previews v1: day strip, The Line (spread, total,
  market score, win chance), The Teams (record, net / off / def rating, pace, home, away, last
  10), Offense vs Defense (13 rows, each offense next to what the other defense allows, colored vs
  the league from each unit's side, same two-sided Mismatch / Tough / Good vs Good tags as the NFL
  cards), Rotations, Injuries, Recent Games.
- It does NOT load common.js (NFL-specific); it shares style.css and sync.js. New NBA styles are
  `.nba-*`. The NHL page reuses the layout ones (`.nba-two`, `.nba-box`, `.nba-tile`, `.nba-app`),
  so check `site/nhl/` after changing them. Pace is shown without a good/bad color (fast or slow isn't good or bad).
- **Not built yet** (waiting on the user's priorities): Summary card, player props, model, picks,
  play-by-play tools (shot zones, first basket, quarter splits).
